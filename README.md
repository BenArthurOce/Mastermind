# Mastermind
Mastermind Game. Difficulty Settings

Hello. This is the first project i ever completed fully and the first code that I have uploaded.
I am satified with how this works.

Current things that i need to add:
- Instructions (Readme file)
- Communications and commands for "Intstructions", "Resign", and "Display" while in game. Instructions still need to be typed up
- Clean code by renaming variables to better match python standards
